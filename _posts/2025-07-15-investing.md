##The biggest investment is investing in yourself and then managing the net income is your key to your next achievement.

Note: Net worth is not net income, having net worth of 6 figures doesn't mean you are taking 6 figures per year. It's the total worth of assets - liabilities.


Building wealth at 26 years old in Albania is quite difficult. The average salary is around $750 per month, and in a country with limited financial opportunities, it can take decades to reach your first 6 figures net worth. 
For me, it took four years — not including the years I spent studying before landing my first tech job.

If you're a young employee like me, your biggest challenge will be managing your income. With inflation rising every year and rent prices constantly increasing, it becomes nearly impossible for anyone that is young to afford their first home.

NOTE: This isn’t a financial guide, a consulting service, or one of those “make $100K from home” courses 😂. 
I'm simply sharing how I reached a personal milestone: building a net worth of over $100K without any debt by the age of 26. Most people my age are just starting their careers after university and are still searching for a decent-paying job.

The Approach I Took: Save & Invest

Your income is the key. What you earn annually should work for you, through investments that generate passive income.

Let’s take an example: if you earn $60K a year (or $5K/month), will you spend it all or invest a portion of it?

Personally, I went hardcore with saving — up to 85% of my income. Yes, it’s mentally tough, but the results are worth it. You’ve heard the phrase: “No pain, no gain.” It applies here,not physically, but financially and mentally.

Ask yourself as a young person: What will you do with your money if you just save it? Saving alone doesn’t protect your money from inflation, which decreases its value over time.

How I Started Investing at 24

I began by investing in a fund through a local bank. As a first-time investor, the results were encouraging. In 8 months, I earned a return of 3.5% — that’s over 1k+ in passive income, all while I was sleeping. I started this investment gradually at age 24.

This was a better option than keeping the money in saving account with minimal interest. My chosen fund was low-risk and stable, investing mainly in government bonds. Eventually, I planned to withdraw the money to help purchase my first home.

Eliminating rent was a big milestone. Owning property, especially in the capital city, is a long-term investment. While I gave up the daily passive income from the fund, I saved more by no longer paying rent. I consider this one of the smartest financial moves I’ve made until now.

I’m not telling you to invest in funds — you have many other options: like Bitcoin,stock market, ETFs, and more. The important thing is to start as soon as possible.

Mindset is everything. These things aren’t taught in school for sure. For me, I followed Dave Ramsey's philosophy: avoid debt, buy your first home as soon as possible, and invest at least 15% of your income.
