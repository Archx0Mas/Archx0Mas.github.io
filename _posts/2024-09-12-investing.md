##The biggest investment is investing in yourself and then managing the net income is your key to your next achievement. (This is a phrase that i like too much)


Building wealth at 26 years old in Albania is quite difficult. The average salary is around $750 per month, and in a country with limited financial opportunities, it can take decades to reach your first $100K. For me, it took four years — not including the years I spent studying before landing my first tech job.

If you're a young employee like me, your biggest challenge will be managing your income. With inflation rising every year and rent prices constantly increasing, it becomes nearly impossible for anyone aged 22-28 to afford their first home.

NOTE: This isn’t a financial guide, a consulting service, or one of those “make $100K from home” courses 😂. 
I'm simply sharing how I reached a personal milestone: building a net worth of over $100K without any debt by the age of 26. Most people my age are just starting their careers after university and are still searching for a decent-paying job.

The Approach I Took: Save & Invest

Your income is the key. What you earn annually should work for you — through investments that generate passive income.

Let’s take an example: if you earn $60K a year (or $5K/month), will you spend it all or invest a portion of it?

Personally, I went hardcore with saving — up to 90% of my income. Yes, it’s mentally tough, but the results are worth it. You’ve heard the phrase: “No pain, no gain.” It applies here — not physically, but financially and mentally.

Ask yourself: What will you do with your money if you just save it? Saving alone doesn’t protect your money from inflation, which erodes its value over time.

How I Started Investing at 24

I began by investing in a fund through a local bank. As a first-time investor, the results were encouraging. In 8 months, I earned a return of 3.5% — that’s over 1k+ in passive income, all while I was sleeping. I started this investment gradually at age 24.

This was a better option than keeping the money in a savings account with minimal interest. My chosen fund was low-risk and stable, investing mainly in government bonds. Eventually, I planned to withdraw the money to help purchase my first home.

Eliminating rent was a big milestone. Owning property — especially in the capital city — is a long-term investment. While I gave up the daily passive income from the fund, I saved more by no longer paying rent. I consider this one of the smartest financial moves I’ve made.

I’m not telling you to invest in funds — you have many options: from high-risk assets like Bitcoin to the stock market, forex, and more. The important thing is to start.

Mindset is everything. These things aren’t taught in school. For me, I followed Dave Ramsey's philosophy: avoid debt, buy your first home as soon as possible, and invest at least 15% of your income.
