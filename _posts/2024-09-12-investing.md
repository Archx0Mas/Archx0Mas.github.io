##The biggest investment is investing in yourself and then managing the net income is your key to your next achievement. (very good phrase)


Building wealth at 26 year old in Albania is quite difficult since the avarage salary is 750$ and it can take decades to build your first 100k$ in a poor country like Albania. For me it took 4 years without including the years i studied before i took my first technology job. If you are a young employe like me, your biggest problem will be spending and managing your income from the job, since the inflation gets prices higher and higher every year, the rent prices get higher so it becomes difficult for every young man at age 18-26 to buy it's first home. 

NOTE: This is not going to be any guide, any financial consulting thing, or any of those "courses" that sell how to make 1m$, 100k from homeðŸ˜‚, i'm here to explain my milestone reaching more than 100k net worth (net worth = assets - liabilities) without debt at this young age. Most fo the persons in this age are just starting working since they have finish the university and struggle to find the best job.

I followed a simple road: Save & Invest.
Your income is your key it means what you get anually you should invest it to take more money while you sleep. 
Lets take an example: 60k/year means 5k a month, you will spend all of your income or you will invest it?
For me i rather go hard saving like 90% of the income, it hits hard on your mind but you will have more results.
You know that phrase "No pain no gain" hahaha but in mind not physically. 
You should ask again yourself what you will do with them if you save the money? since that doesnt save you from loosing money (due to inflation moeny becomes less in value). 

I invested in funds in one of the banks and the return for me as the 1st time investing wasn't bad, for 8 months i got a return to 3.5% which means i did my first 1k while sleeping and i started at 24 year old investing in this fund gradually. Sincerely it was better result than puting your money in the bank to take some % interest. Funds depends on level risks, some funds have higher risk = more reward, but mine was low risk and stable win since the fund invests the whole their money in buying bonds of the state.

Removing rent is a good step in saving more money so you can invest it later. So after the fund, i invested on my 1st home, the home price will go up especially if you buy in the capital city.
Mindest is very important in this phase since these things are not tought in school but for me i followed Dave Ramsey. He has good point: no debt, get 1st home as fast as you can, save and invest 15% of your income.
