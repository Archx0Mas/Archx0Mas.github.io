##The biggest investment is investing in yourself and then managing the net income is your key to your next achievement. (very good phrase)


Building wealth at 26 year old in Albania is quite difficult since the avarage salary is 750$ and it can take decades to build your first 100k$ in a poor country like Albania. For me it took 4 years without including the years i studied before i took my first technology job. If you are a young employe like me, your biggest problem will be spending and managing your income from the job, since the inflation gets prices higher and higher every year, the rent prices get higher so it becomes difficult for every young man at age 18-26 to buy it's first home. 

NOTE: This is not going to be any guide, any financial consulting thing, or any of those "courses" that sell how to make 1m$, 100k from homeðŸ˜‚, i'm here to explain my milestone reaching more than 100k net worth (net worth = assets - liabilities) without debt at this young age. Most of the persons in this age have just started to work since they have finished the university and are struggling to find a job that pays best.

I followed a simple road: Save & Invest.
Your income is your key it means what you get anually you should invest it to take more money while you sleep (Passive income) 
Lets take an example: 60k/year means 5k a month, you will spend all of your income or you will invest it?
For me i rather go hard saving like 90% of the income, it hits hard on your mind but you will have more results.
You know that phrase "No pain no gain" hahaha but in mind not physically. 
You should ask again yourself what you will do with ðŸ’µ if you save the money? since it doesn't save you from loosing money (due to inflation money becomes less in value). 

For me my journey how i started in investing is as below:
I invested in funds in one of the banks and the return for me as the 1st time investing wasn't bad, for 8 months i got a return to 3.5% which means i did my first 1k+ while sleeping as a passive income and i started at 24 year old investing in this fund gradually. Sincerely it was better result than puting your money in the bank to take some % interest. Funds depends on level risks, some funds have higher risk = more reward, but mine was low risk and stable win since the fund invests the whole their money in buying bonds of the state amd i also wanted it for later to remove from the fund and to buy house.

Removing rent is a good step in saving more money so you can invest later in other things. 
After the fund, i invested on my 1st home, the home price will go up especially if you buy in the capital city.
This wi remove my passive income from the fund % return every day, but it will save me from laying the rent which is more than the passive income i could win in the fund. I can call this a smart thing i did for myself.
I'm not suggesting to imvest in funds, you have planty of choices from bitcoin ( high risk) to sotck market, forex and other things you can invest and you can win more.

Mindest is very important in this phase since these things are not tought in school but for me i followed Dave Ramsey. He has good point: no debt, get 1st home as fast as you can, save and invest 15% of your income.
